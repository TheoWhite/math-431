Given that P={a,b}

Base case p()
$$P(0)={\emptyset}$$
Therefore :$$2^0 = 1$$
So if x = {a} The power set is $P=\{a,\emptyset\}$
So the inductive hypothesis output is P(x) = 2^k
Now create y which contains all of x and a new element so $P(y)=2^{(k+1)}$
Therefore 
$y = 2^k$ (with b) + 2k (without b) = $2 \cdot 2^k = 2^{k+1}$
