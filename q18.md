Since g(a,b) = 1

1 - ar = bs

if d $\in  \mathbb{N}$ such that d | a and d|s. Then ar is a multiple of d and bs is a multiple of d. So bs + ar = 1. 
Since 1 is not a multiple of d therefore gcd (a,s) = 1.

For gcd(r,b) = 1 1-bs = ar
If d $\in \mathbb{N}$ . Then ar + br is a multiple of d. Then ar+br since 1 is not a multiple of d we have a contradiction therefore gcd(r,b) = 1. 

Therefore proof that gcd(a,d) = 1 and r & s are integers such that ar + bs = 1. Then gcd(a,s) = gcd(r,b) = gcd(r,s)= 1.
